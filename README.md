# NYC_Service_Calls

In 2009, New York City, New York city officials collected data regarding 311 service calls. Using their dataset, data analysis was performed using Python, to determine the top ten complaints types that occurred that year. This type of data analysis can be very useful for city officials because it gives them insight on how to best serve their citizens. The Python code and Jupyter Notebook files regarding my analysis can be found in my repository called NYC_Service_Calls.
