    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2009, all of the 311 service calls that took place in New York City, New York were collected and stored in a dataframe. Analyzing service calls can be quite beneficial for city officials because it reveals the pressing needs or concerns of the residents. For example, service calls may include heating/air conditioning issues or traffic light problems. The objective of this analysis will be to find out the top ten complaints the residents of New York City called in and reported. This report will also try to find any trends regarding the location where each call took place. All analysis was performed using Python within Jupyter Notebook. "

Now, there are several ways to get access to Jupyter Notebook and if needed, there are numerous tutorials, blogs, and videos online to help. However, it is recommened to download Anaconda in order to gain easy access to everything needed for data analysis. Below, the steps to perform the data analysis on 311 service calls that took place in NYC are listed out. All related files to this project can be found on github [here](https://github.com/jekight/NYC_Service_Calls).\n",

Since the objective of this report is to determine the top five complaints in NYC in the year 2009, one of the most important variables has to be complaint type. Below, a slicing technique is used in order to create a subset of the data in which only the complaint type is shown.

    "Using data collected by the city of New York, this analysis found the top ten 311 service calls, with heating being the number one complaint residents called about. Performing data analysis on data such as this is important because it provides city officals with intel on how to better serve their citizens. For example, heating seems to be a pressing need among the residents that needs to be address. With this information, city officials will know how to please the most individuals. By allocating more funds to new heaters or heating repairs, the number of complaints regarding heating should dissipate, thus satisfying the most people. However, this analysis can be taken a step further by visualizing where most of the complaints take place. This would ensure that changes are not happening where there are not problems to begin with. Each city has a specific budget and would not be able to afford to correct everything at once. Thus, it would be imperative that every action has the maximum impact. "
